To setup the node server, change ./node-server/config/db-config.js to necessary values to connect to your database

In ./node-server run "node db-setup.js" to populate the database with the initial values

In ./node-server run "node server.js" to start the node server

In ./react-client run "npm start" to start the react app

The username and password to login are prefilled, you only need to hit login to authenticate

The functionality for Purchase was not completed, the page is there to show what was done
